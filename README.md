### DEV INSTALL

This code is written for Python 3. 

Be careful to use the Python 3 version of virtualenv if you wish to edit, test and run the code. 

Once virtualenv is activated, install requirements with pip3. 

The following shows how: 

```~/brewcompute$ python3 -m venv venv_popos
~/brewcompute$ . venv_popos/bin/activate
~/brewcompute$ which pip3
/home/ibowman/brewcompute/venv_popos/bin/pip3
~/brewcompute$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Collecting flake8 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
...
```
